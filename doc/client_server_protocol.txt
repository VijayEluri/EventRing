How does the client talk to the server?:

scenario 1:
Maybe communicate via "events"?
-) server sends an event representing a "ready to serve" and/or 
   whats on the menu.
-) client sends an event representing the request for an event.
-) the server sends the event
-) repeat as needed while connected
-) there is a disconnect event that will break the socket-thread
-) the socket-thread can also break on a certain time-out


scenario 2:
less verbose.
client and server know ahead of time how to communicate and whats
avilable.
-) client connects to server
-) server replies with and event


scenario 3:
a hybrid
client connects

events:

"general ready to serve events" event:
^:READY:$

"give me an event" event:
^:GIVE:$

"hangup connection" event:
^:HANGUP:$
