For now the events will be represented as ascii strings.
similiar to how /etc/passwd is setup.

:name1:val1:name2:val2:name3:val3:...:...  

The 1st character will be the seperator for that event
(the above could also be:
#name1#val1#name2#val2#name3#val3#...#...    )

there will be a way to just get the names, or just get the values:
NAMES:
:name1:name2:name3:...
VALS:
:val1:val2:val3:...

Should we end the string with the seperator?
(We *should* at least allow it.)
Should we allow multiple seperators in a row?

valid?:
###name1##val1#####name2#val2#name3############val3#...#...####

as strings got cutnpasted this might be helpful, and theres
no real drawback to allowing it.
* There is a drawback !
The case where we might want a blank value for a name.

^:asdasd:213123:wdsdf sdf sd:qddqd d dqwd: d we f wef :dwedwed:$
^#asdasd#213123#wdsdf sdf sd#qddqd d dqwd# d we f wef #dwedwed#$

* The latest is we can have blank vals, but not blank keys.
* there cannot be a trailing "sep" before the "$"
